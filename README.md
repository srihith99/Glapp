A Glucose Monitoring and Diabetes diagnosis app that provides realtime glucose metrics (of a person) in a completely non invasive manner (i.e without actually taking subject's blood). The app also conveys the risk of diabetes based on existing medical records and the past readings of the user 

Using the app : ( Refer to the video file as well )
1) Insert the finger of the subject into the sensor slot
2) Wait for 30 seconds
3) Get the glucose readings and diagnosis on the app
5) Should the glucose level be critically high or low , an alert message shall be sent to the emergency contact( preferably the family doctor ).
